					As stated previously, <strong>Ajax</strong> stands for <strong><i>Asynchronous JavaScript And XML</i></strong>.<br><br><br>
					<b>Q : </b>But what exactly does that mean?<br><br>
					Doing things Synchrously in Java Script<br><br>
					<pre>
var data = database.query("SELECT Id FROM Employee");
console.log(data);
console.log("this is synchrous java script");</pre>
					Doing things Asynchrously in java script<br><br>
					<pre>
database.query("SELECT Id FROM Employee", function(data) {
    console.log(data);
});
console.log("this is asynchorous java script");</pre><br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					In First Case program will wait for the function database.query() to complete and then go to next line. But in the next case program will not wait for the function and will print the message in console before the query has been completed.
					<br><br>
					the result of above will be<br><br>
					<pre>
I case:
all the Id's
this is synchrous java script

II case:
this is asynchrous java script
all the Id's 	</pre><br><br>
