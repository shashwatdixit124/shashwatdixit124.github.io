description: Macros allow us to abstract at a syntactic level. A macro invocation is shorthand for an "expanded" syntactic form. In Rust we can use Pattern Matching to create a hard looking code but at the same very useful like vec! macro .

					In Summer 2016 I was working on a project, an Application which can send messages and files to other computers on a LAN (Just like IPMessenger).
					I'm not that creative in naming a project, So what better than IPConnect. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I was new to Qt as well as Software Development, so IPConnect's code structure was a disaster. 
					It was a working application but not complete. No User notification, Bad Gui , No Download Manager to show downloads and their progress only way to see if a download is happening is to look at the terminal. I stopped working on this project.
				</p>
				<p>
					I learned a lot over the year, and was working to fix bugs on kdev-php a Php Language Plugin for <a href="https://kdevelop.org">KDevelop</a> due to which I learned about Software Development and SOLID Principles, so this summer I thought to make IPConnect from scratch with a new and better Code Base and GUI.
				</p>
				<p>
				<b>Here is a glimpse of IPConnect Version 2</b>
				</p>
				<br>

				<p>
				<b>What's new in Version 2 ? </b>
				</p>
				<p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>GUI</b></li>
					<p>Version 2 has New User Interface made with Qt Quick based on Flat Design.</p>
					<li><b>Download Manager</b></li>
					<p>Download Manager View provides User with option to accept or reject a transfer and show it's progress.</p>
					<li><b>Settings View</b></li>
					<p>User can change default settings using Settings View ex: user name , color theme, etc.</p>
					<li><b>Encryption</b></li>
					<p>IPConnect uses <code>RSA</code> 2048 bit and <code>AES</code> 256 bit encryption for sending messages or files.</p>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
				<b>How does IPConnect work ? </b>
				</p>
				<p>
				Project can be further broken into two liraries <code>IPConnect</code> and <code>IPConnectUi</code>. IPConnect implements all the buiseness logic and IPConnectUi uses IPConnect implement GUI for App.
				</p>
				<p>
				At it's core, <br>
				IPConnect listens for <code>Connection</code> on port 2423 (for <code>Transfers</code>) and 2424 (for <code>Clients</code>). When a new connection is available say on port 2424 IPConnect knows that a <code>Client</code> is connecting for sharing information and messages and if a connection is made on port 2423 it resolves to a <code>Transfer</code> request.
				</p>
				<p>
				Connection is made secure by sharing <code>RSA</code> public keys.
				</p>
				<p>
				IPConnect has it's own protocol for talking to another IPConnect instance running on other machine. Messages are sent in JSON format which is encrypted before sending. A Message without encryption looks like 
				</p>
				<br>
<pre>
{
	"DATA": {
		"FILENAME": "ipconnect-api-doc.pdf",
		"FILESIZE": "225689",
		"USERNAME": "Aviato"
	},
	"METHOD": 2,
	"OPTION": 4
}
</pre>
				<p>
				<code>Message</code> above is a File Request i.e. some user "Aviato" is sending a file "ipconnect-api-doc.pdf" of size 225689 Bytes. <code>Message</code> is parsed and appropriate action is taken, in this case notifying user that a file request is pending.
